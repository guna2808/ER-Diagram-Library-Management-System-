## 📚 ER Diagram Practice – Library Management System

✨ This repository highlights my hands-on practice with **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**, focusing on designing a **Library Management System**.

🧩 The ER diagram is built by identifying core entities such as **Member**, **Book**, and **Borrow**, reflecting how a real-world library operates.

🔑 I carefully defined:

* Entity attributes
* **Primary Keys** for unique identification
* **Foreign Keys** to establish relationships
* **One-to-Many relationships** between entities

🧠 The diagram is created using the **Mermaid web tool**, which helped me visually translate real-world scenarios into a structured and logical **database model**.

🚀 This practice strengthened my understanding of:

* Database design fundamentals
* Data modeling concepts
* Relationship mapping between entities
* Preparing schemas for backend applications

📌 Overall, this exercise improved my ability to think from a **backend and database perspective**, which is essential for building scalable and maintainable systems.
