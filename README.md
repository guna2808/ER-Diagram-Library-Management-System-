## 📚 ER Diagram Practice – Library Management System

✨ This repository showcases my hands-on practice with **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**.
🧩 I designed an ER diagram for a **Library Management System** by identifying key entities like **Member**, **Book**, and **Borrow**.
🔑 I worked on defining attributes, **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **one-to-many relationships**.
🧠 The diagram is created using the **Mermaid web tool**, helping me understand how real-world scenarios translate into structured database models.
🚀 This practice strengthened my database design and data modeling skills.
